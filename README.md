# hypixel-status-webhook

## What does this do?
This triggers a webhook when the hypixel api gets a bit laggy or there is an issue/problem set by hypixel

## How to initialise?

1. run `yarn/npm install`
2. remove the `example.` infront of the `webhooks.json` so that it is all that is left
3. add webhooks to that like a normal array
4. run `npm run start`
